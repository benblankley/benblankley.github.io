{"name":"Benblankley.GitHub.io","tagline":"","body":"### Experiments in Open Source\r\nHello all, this is a space where I am going to post some of my latest experiments in open source development.\r\n\r\n### NaNoGenMo 2015\r\nNaNoWriMo is an annual fiction writing project that lots of writers all around the world participate in, during the month of November. Darius Kazemi created NaNoGenMo, an annual event for programmers to generate 50K word \"novels\" using code. I participated, and here is my submission: [This Is Just To Code](https://github.com/benblankley/NaNoGenMo2015)\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/pages) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
